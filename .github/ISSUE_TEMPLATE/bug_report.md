Please try to provide the following:

- steps to reproduce and/or logging of the error
- version of owntone
- platform

Steps to reproduce will greatly improve the chance of getting it fixed. If it is not possible then set the log level to debug (in /etc/owntone.conf) and try to get some logging of when the error happens. Donâ€™t cut and paste lengthy log outtakes here on github. Instead, attach the log file. Remove parts of the log file that aren't relevant and also make sure to delete Spotify username/tokens.
