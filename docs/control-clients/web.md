# Web Interface

The built-in web interface is a mobile-friendly music player and browser for
OwnTone.

You can reach it at [http://owntone.local:3689](http://owntone.local:3689)
or depending on the OwnTone installation at `http://<server-address>:<port>`.

This interface becomes useful when you need to control playback, trigger
manual library rescans, pair with remotes, select speakers, grant access to
Spotify, and for many other operations.

Alternatively, you can use a MPD web client like for instance [ympd](http://www.ympd.org/).

## Usage

The web interface is usually reachable at [http://owntone.local:3689](http://owntone.local:3689).
But depending on the setup of OwnTone you might need to adjust the server name
and port of the server accordingly `http://<server-name>:<port>`.
