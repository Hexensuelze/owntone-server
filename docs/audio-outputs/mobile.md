# Listening on your Mobile Device

## iOS

On iOS, the options are limited because there are no Media Client apps with DAAP
support and because Apple doesn't allow AirPlay receiver apps. OwnTone also
can't share music via Home Sharing, which is the protocol Apple uses for sharing
media between devices.

That leaves the following options, which all rely on OwnTone's streaming:

- listen via the [web interface](web.md)
- use a [MPD client app](../control-clients/mobile.md#mpd-client-apps) that supports local playback
- connect to the [streaming](streaming.md) endpoint with a media player like VLC

## Android

On Android, you can use the same streaming methods described for iOS, but you
can also find apps that act as AirPlay receivers.
