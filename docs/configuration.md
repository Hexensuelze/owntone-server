# Configuration

The configuration of OwnTone - usually located in `/etc/owntone.conf` - is split into multiple sections:

- [`general`](#general-settings) - Main settings of OwnTone.
- [`library`](#library-settings) - Settings of local library.
- [`audio`](#local-audio-settings) - Settings for the local audio.
- [`alsa`](#per-alsa-device-settings) - Settings for ALSA devices.
- [`fifo`](#fifo-settings) - Settings for named pipe.
- [`airplay_shared`](#shared-airplay-settings) - Settings shared across AirPlay devices.
- [`airplay`](#per-airplay-device-settings) - Settings for a specific AirPlay device.
- [`chromecast`](#per-chromecast-device-settings) - Settings for a specific Chromecast device.
- [`spotify`](#spotify-settings) - Settings for the Spotify playback.
- [`rcp`](#rcproku-soundbridge-settings) - Settings for RCP / Roku Soundbridge devices.
- [`mpd`](#mpd-settings) - Settings for MPD clients.
- [`sqlite`](#sqlite-settings) - Settings for SQLite operation.
- [`streaming`](#streaming-settings) - Settings for the streaming.

## Format

Each section consists of a name enclosing settings within parentheses.

Each setting consists of a name and a value. There are different types of settings: string, integer, boolean, and list.

Comments are preceded by a hash sign.

The format is as follow:

```conf
# Section
section {
    # String value
    setting = "<string-value>"
    # Integer value
    setting = <integer-value>
    # Boolean
    setting = <true|false>
    # List
    setting = { "value a", "value b", "value n"}
}
```

**Note:** For a regular use, the most important settings are:

- the `directories` (see [`library`](#library-settings) section), which should be the location of your media, and
- the `uid` (see [`general`](#general-settings) section), which must have read access to those directories.

### no_decode

List of formats that are never decoded.

**Note:** Decoding options for DAAP and RSP clients. Since iTunes has native support for mpeg, mp4a, mp4v, alac and wav, such files will be sent as they are. Any other formats will be decoded to raw wav. If OwnTone detects a non-iTunes DAAP client, it is assumed to only support mpeg and wav, other formats will be decoded. Here you can change when to decode. Note that these settings only affect serving media to DAAP and RSP clients, they have no effect on direct AirPlay, Chromecast and local audio playback

**Valid values:** `mp4a`, `mp4v`, `mpeg`, `alac`, `flac`, `mpc`, `ogg`, `wma`, `wmal`, `wmav`, `aif`, `wav`.

**Note:** These filters are ffmpeg filters: i.e. similar to those specified on the command line `ffmpeg -af <filter>`. Examples: `"volume=replaygain=track"` to use replay gain of the track metadata, or `loudnorm=I=-16:LRA=11:TP=-1.5` to normalise volume.

**Default:** unset

```conf
decode_audio_filters = { "<filter>" }
```

### decode_video_filters

List of video filters used at decoding time.

```

### rating_updates

Flag to indicate whether or not ratings are automatically updated.

**Note:** When enabled, the rating is automatically updated after a song has either been played or skipped (only skipping to the next song is taken into account). The calculation is taken from the beets plugin "mpdstats" (see [here](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/mpdstats.html)). It consists of calculating a stable rating based only on the play and skip count and a rolling rating based on the current rating and the action (played or skipped). Both results are combined with a mix factor of 0.75. **Formula:** new rating = 0.75 × stable rating + 0.25 × rolling rating

**Default:** `false`

```conf
rating_updates = <true|false>
```

### read_rating

Flag to indicate whether or not the rating is read from media file metadata.

**Default:** `false`

```conf
read_rating = <true|false>
```

### write_rating

Flag to indicate whether or not the rating is written back to the file metadata.

**Note:** By default, ratings are only saved in the database. To avoid excessive writing to the library, automatic rating updates are not written, even with the write_rating setting enabled.

**Default:** `false`

```conf
write_rating = <true|false>
```

**Default:** `false`

```conf
clear_queue_on_stop_disable = <true|false>
```

**Note:** A Roku / SoundBridge can power up in 2 modes: (default) reconnect to the previously used library (i.e. OwnTone) or in a _cleared library_ mode. The Roku power up behaviour is affected by how OwnTone disconnects from the Roku device. Set to false to maintain the default Roku _power on_ behaviour.

**Default:** `false`

```conf
clear_on_close = false
```

## MPD Settings

```conf
mpd {
  …
}
```

The `mpd` section defines the settings for MPD clients. It accepts the settings below.

**Note:** These settings only have effect if OwnTone is built with Spotify support.

### port

TCP port to listen for MPD client requests.

**Note:** Setting the port to `0` disables the support for MPD.

**Default:** `6600`

```conf
port = 6600
```

### http_port

HTTP port to listen for artwork requests.

**Notes:**

- This setting is only supported by some MPD clients and will need additional configuration in the MPD client to work.
- Setting the port to `0` disables the serving of artwork.

**Default:** `0`

```conf
http_port = 0
```

## SQLite Settings

```conf
sqlite {
  …

**Note:** Make sure to read the SQLite documentation for the corresponding PRAGMA statements as changing them from the defaults may increase the possibility of database corruption. By default, the SQLite default values are used.

### pragma_cache_size_library

Cache size in number of database pages for the library database.

**Note:** SQLite default page size is 1024 bytes and cache size is 2000 pages.

```conf
pragma_cache_size_library = <pages>
```

### pragma_cache_size_cache

Cache size in number of db pages for the cache database.

**Note:** SQLite default page size is 1024 bytes and cache size is 2000 pages.

```conf
pragma_cache_size_cache = <pages>
```

### pragma_journal_mode

Sets the journal mode for the database. Valid values are: `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, `PERSIST`, `MEMORY`, `WAL`, and `OFF`.

### pragma_synchronous

Change the setting of the "synchronous" flag.

**Valid values:** `0` (off), `1` (normal), `2` (full)

**Default:** `2`

```conf
pragma_synchronous = <0|1|2>
```

### pragma_mmap_size_library

Number of bytes set aside for memory-mapped I/O for the library database.

**Notes:** This setting requires SQLite 3.7.17+.

**Valid values:** `0` (mmap disabled), `<integer>` (bytes for mmap)

**Default:** `0`

```conf
pragma_mmap_size_library = <integer>
```

### pragma_mmap_size_cache

Number of bytes set aside for memory-mapped I/O for the cache database.

**Note:** This setting requires SQLite 3.7.17+.

**Valid values:** `0` (mmap disabled), `<integer>` (bytes for mmap)

```conf
pragma_mmap_size_cache = <integer>
```

### vacuum

Flag indicating whether or not the database must be vacuumed on startup.

**Note:** This setting increases the startup time, but may reduce database size.

**Default:** `true`

```conf
vacuum = <true|false>
```

## Streaming Settings

```conf
streaming {
  …
}
```

The `streaming` section defines the audio settings for the streaming URL (`http://<server-name>:<port-number>/stream.mp3`) and accepts the settings below.

### sample_rate

Sampling rate of the stream: e.g., 44100, 48000, etc.

**Default:** `44100`

```conf
sample_rate = <integer>
```

### bit_rate

Bit rate of the stream (in kb/s).

**Valid values:** `64`, `96`, `128`, `192`, and `320`.

**Default:** `192`

```conf
bit_rate = <64|96|128|192|320>
```

### icy_metaint

Number of bytes of media stream data between each metadata chunk.

**Default:** `16384`

```conf
